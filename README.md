# Useful Raylib Files/Scripts

After creating a project/directory copy raylib-vcpkg-script.ps1 to the directory and run it. Fast and easy setup for Raylib on windows.
- Use this if you don't want to compile every time you make changes 

Drop the files from raylib-template-project-VS into the directory that your Raylib project is in. Make sure to use #include "include/raylib.h". You have to compile this every time you make changes, but you can use the .ps1 file to compile.
