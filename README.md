# Useful Raylib Files/Scripts

Drop the files from raylib-template-project-VS into the directory that your Raylib project is in. Make sure to use #include "include/raylib.h". You have to compile this every time you make changes, but you can use the .ps1 file to compile. 

raylib-vcpkg-script.ps1 is a simple script to setup a new version of vcpkg and install the raylib library
