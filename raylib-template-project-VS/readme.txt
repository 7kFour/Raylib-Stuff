Also I have notes in my 'c/c++/rust/go/git' notebook under 'c++/GameDev/Libraries/Raylib'

just drop these files in to whatever directory has your source code in it 

you can use these with any IDE 

this is raylib 4.0 so you will need to recompile the libraylib.a file if you want to use a newer version 

#include "include/raylib.h" 

run the compile.ps1 and you should be good to go
